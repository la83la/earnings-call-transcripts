      "speech": "Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for today's conference call and review of our business results for the 3rd quarter 2021. Joining us today are Brian Chambers Owens Corning's Chair and Chief Executive Officer and Ken Parks, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our presentation this morning, we will open this one-hour call to your questions. In order to accommodate as many call participants as possible, please limit yourselves to one question only. Earlier this morning we issued a news release and filed a 10-Q that detailed our financial results for the 3rd quarter 2021.\nFor the purposes of our discussion today, we have prepared presentation slides that summarize our performance and results and we will refer to these slides during this call. You can access the earnings press release, Form 10-Q and the presentation slides at our website Owens Corning.com refer to the Investors link under the Corporate section of our homepage. A transcript and recording of this call in the supporting slides will be available on our website for future reference. Please reference Slide 2 before we begin where we offer a couple of reminders. First, today's remarks will include forward-looking statements based on our current forecast and estimates of future events. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update these statements beyond what is required under applicable securities laws. Please refer to the cautionary statements and the risk factors identified in our SEC filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent risks and uncertainties affecting such forward-looking statements. Second, the presentation slides and today's remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures may be found in the text and financial tables of our earnings press release and presentation, both of which are available on Owens Corning.com. Adjusted EBIT is our primary measure of period over period comparisons, and we believe it is a meaningful measure for investors to compare our results. Consistent with our historical practice, we have excluded certain items that we believe are not representative of our ongoing operations when calculating adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings. We adjust our effective tax rate to remove the effect of quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, which have the potential to be significant in arriving at adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. We also use free cash flow and free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings as measures helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash and utilize that cash to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. The tables in today's news release in the Form 10-Q include more detailed financial information. For those of you following along with our slide presentation, we will begin on Slide 4 and now opening remarks from our Chair and CEO Brian Chambers, Brian."

      "speech": "Thanks, Amber. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. I hope all of you are staying healthy and safe. Owens Corning posted strong 3rd quarter results today consistent with our July outlook and building on the momentum of an outstanding first half of the year. Our global team continued to execute extremely well in a very dynamic environment overcoming higher inflation as well as some supply chain disruptions to deliver another great quarter. Our results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our team, the strength of our commercial and operational execution and the durability of the earnings power of our company. During the call this morning. I'll start with an overview of our 3rd quarter performance before turning that over to Ken who will provide additional details on our financial results.\nI'll then come back to talk about our business outlook for the remainder of the year. As always, I will begin my review of safety. During the 3rd quarter, our commitment to safety resulted in an RIR of 0.64, which is a significant improvement compared to the same period last year, with more than half of our facilities operating injury-free for more than a year. While we are generally encouraged by the recent decrease in COVID cases and gradual increase in vaccinations, It's clear the impacts of the pandemic will persist in the near term. We will continue to follow enhanced safety protocols and operate our facilities with a strong focus on working together to keep each other, our customers and our suppliers healthy and safe. Financially, we delivered record 3rd quarter revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 16% compared with the same period last year and adjusted EBIT of $400 million.\nOur performance during the quarter was again a combination of strong market volumes and outstanding execution with each business delivering a positive price cost mix and great manufacturing performance. This resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin for the Company of 18% with all 3 of our businesses, posting double-digit EBIT margins for a 5th consecutive quarter. Demand for our US residential products which account for about half of our enterprise revenues as well as our commercial industrial products remained strong in Q3 and we continue to operate with extended lead times for many of our products. Within this tight supply chain environment, our global teams, especially in supply chain, manufacturing, customer service and sales continue to work extremely hard to increase our production and meet the needs of our customers. In addition to our focus to finish the year strong, we continue to make strategic choices to enhance the earnings power of the company and create additional growth opportunities by allocating resources to product lines where we can strengthen our market position and provide a sustainable solution.\nI would like to take a few moments now to share more about the work we are doing with 2 of our product lines to position us for the future. As part of our focus to build market-leading positions, we continuously evaluate the strength of our products and position in the market. Based on this analysis, we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for one of our glass reinforcements product lines within our composites business thermoplastic dry use chopped strands. The Dutch product line is primarily used in automotive and electronic applications and generates annual revenues of approximately $270 million. The focus of our valuation will include divesting or repurposing these assets to manufacture other product lines, whether it's material science capabilities and relationships across a variety of core markets, applications and geographies, our composites business is an integral part of our company and a key contributor to our growth strategy.\nThe decision to explore alternatives for these production assets and product line is consistent with our approach to focus on high-value material solutions where we can develop market-leading positions, such as in building a construction, renewable energy and infrastructure. Product and process innovation continues to be keyed how we drive growth, improve our operating performance and create value for our customers. A great example this ongoing work is our PINK Next Gen Fiberglass Insulation launched in August. This latest product innovation leverages advanced fiber technology to create a sustainable product that is faster and more comfortable to install compared to existing products in this space. This is particularly important given the performance expectations and tight timelines of today's contractors and builders.\nGiven our commitment to sustainability, I'm pleased to note that PINK Next Gen insulation is made with 100% wind powered electricity in such an industry standard for recycled content. Our launch of Next Gen fiberglass insulation, is the most recent example of how our industry leadership and innovation is expanding growth opportunities for our customers and Owens Corning. We are also excited to see how our sustainability leadership and mission to build a sustainable future through material innovation is creating new growth opportunities across the enterprise. As we engage with more and more customers to develop solutions which achieve their key sustainability goals.\nThe priority topics for collaboration focus on decarbonization including product specific embodied carbon reduction, circular economy, which includes both recycled content and end of life recycling solutions and product design transparency specifically related to the impact of our products throughout their lifecycle. We look forward to sharing more details about these exciting developments to help our customers and grow our company during our upcoming Investor Day. With that I will now turn it over to Ken to discuss the financial results in more detail, Ken."

      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. As Brian commented Owens Corning delivered another outstanding quarter with strong revenue and earnings growth across all 3 businesses. While demand conditions remain strong across the markets we serve, our ongoing execution was fundamental to driving this performance, allowing us to manage through supply chain challenges and accelerating inflation. As we talked about in our second quarter call, inflation continues to impact almost all material input costs especially asphalt and other petroleum based materials along with transportation and energy costs.\nOverall positive price realization more than offset the inflation headwind in all 3 businesses in the quarter and year-to-date. As a result, 3rd quarter operating margins reached 18% nearly 300 basis points higher than the same period last year. The expanded earnings combined with focused working capital management and capital investments drove healthy free cash flow generation in the quarter and strong free cash flow conversion year-to-date. Now beginning on Slide 5, we can take a closer look at our results.\nWwe reported consolidated net sales of $2.2 billion for the 3rd quarter, that's up 16% over 2020 and produced double-digit revenue growth in all 3 segments. Our commercial and operational execution were instrumental in delivering these results as demand conditions remain strong in the markets we serve and we overcame supply chain disruptions with limited inventories. Adjusted EBIT for the 3rd quarter of 2021 was $400 million, up $111 million compared to the prior year. Earnings grew year-over-year, in all 3 businesses, resulting in double-digit EBIT margins for the 5th consecutive quarter.\nAdjusted earnings for the 3rd quarter were $162 million or $2.52 per diluted share compared to $193 million or $76 per diluted share in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $129 million, up $9 million compared to Q3 2020. our capital additions for the 3rd quarter were $90 million, up $22 million as compared to the 3rd quarter of last year. We'll continue to be disciplined in our capital spending as we focus on delivering strong free cash flow and prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity. Slide 6 reconciles our 3rd quarter adjusted EBIT of $400 million to our reported EBIT of $394 million during the quarter we recorded $20 million of restructuring costs associated with previously announced actions, which includes $19 million for the Santa Clara facility sale. Those charges were partially offset by a $15 million gain on the sale of land related to a previously announced facility closure. In addition, we had $1 million of acquisition related charges for, which was acquired during the quarter.\nThese items are excluded from our adjusted 3rd quarter EBIT. Slide 7 provides an overview of the changes in 3rd quarter adjusted EBIT from 2020, 2021. Q3 adjusted EBIT increased $111 million over the prior year, reaching $400 million. Despite supply chain challenges and accelerating inflation, all 3 segments delivered year-over-year EBIT growth. Now turning to slide 8, I'll provide more details on the performance of each of the businesses. The insulation business, continue to build on the strong performance demonstrated in Q2, delivering double-digit year-over-year EBIT growth and 400 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. Q3 revenues were $815 million, a 20% increase over the 3rd quarter of 2020. We saw solid realization on announced pricing actions, as well as volume growth across the business. Reflecting continued strength in both US new construction and the commercial end markets we serve globally.\nIn North American Residential Fiberglass Insulation, we saw year-over-year growth driven by positive pricing and stronger volumes benefiting from incremental capacity additions over the past year. In technical and global insulation, demand remained strong for our highly specified products with the most notable year-over-year growth coming again from North America and Europe, with growth in both foam glass and mineral wool. Pricing was positive versus prior year and more than double what we achieved in Q2. For the Insulation business overall, positive price more than offset the impact of accelerating energy, material and transportation inflation. In residential insulation, we continue to maintain a positive price cost mix in the face of accelerating inflation. While technical and global insulation price lagged inflation, the price cost gap narrowed considerably versus Q2.\nWe continue to execute well in our manufacturing operations and benefited from the recovery of $18 million of fixed cost absorption on higher production. We delivered margins of 15% and EBIT of $124 million a quarterly record and up from $73 million in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Now please turn to slide 9 for a review of our composites business. The composites business produced another record earnings quarter. Sales for the 3rd quarter were $591 million, up 13% compared to the prior year. The top line growth was driven by strong commercial performance with our ongoing strategy in the business to focus on higher value applications driving favorable mix, which more than offset slightly lower volumes. We continue to see strength in demand for our higher value applications as well as demand in key geographies where our local supply for local demand model is being valued by customers.\nWe also continue to see positive pricing in composites resulting from contract negotiations, as well as price increases for non-contractual business. In the quarter, positive price more than offset the inflation headwinds from materials, energy and higher transportation costs. Operationally, we continued to execute well with solid manufacturing performance and recovery of $29 million of prior year curtailment costs. In the 3rd quarter composites delivered record EBIT of $101 million, up $46 million over last year and EBIT margins reached 17%. Slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business. The roofing business produced a strong 3rd quarter, sales in the quarter were $869 million, up 14% compared to the prior year.\nThe US asphalt shingle market was down 9% in Q3 as compared to the prior year, while our US shingle volumes were up slightly year-over-year. We continue to see good realization on our announced price increases more than offsetting accelerating asphalt, other material and delivery inflation. Contribution margins remained strong. For the quarter, EBIT was $12 million, up 16 million from the prior year, achieving 24% EBIT margins. Turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss significant financial highlights for the 3rd quarter and full year 2021. Earnings expansion along with continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the 3rd quarter of 2021 was $400 million bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $925 million, up $411 million over the same period last year.\nYear-to-date free cash flow conversion remains strong. With this cash flow performance, we further strengthened our already solid investment grade balance sheet by repaying in the quarter the remaining $184 million due on our 2022 senior notes. At quarter end, the company had ample liquidity of approximately $2 billion, consisting of $920 million of cash and nearly point $1.1 billion of combined availability on our bank debt facilities. During the 3rd quarter of 2021, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $160 million. Through September 30, 2021, the company returned $516 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends equating to approximately 56% of year-to-date free cash flow.\nWe remain focused on consistently generating strong free cash flow returning at least 50% to investors over time and maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. Now turning to our 2021 outlook for key financial items, general corporate expenses are expected to range between $150 and $155 million. Capital additions are expected to be approximately $460 million, which is below expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million. For interest expense, we've narrowed our estimated range to be between $125 and $130 million and finally, we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and our cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings.\nNow please turn to Slide 12 and I'll return the call to Brian to further discuss the outlook for our company. Brian."

      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Thank you, Ken. During the 3rd quarter, our company continued to perform well, giving us great momentum as we finish the year. In the 4th quarter, we expect US residential repair and remodeling and new construction markets as well as our global commercial and industrial end markets to remain strong. Based on current trends we are seeing across the enterprise, we anticipate the impact of inflation to be at or slightly above what we experienced in Q3. Given our pricing actions throughout the year, we expect each of the businesses to maintain a positive price cost mix in Q4. Moving through the quarter, we will continue to closely monitor and manage inflation supply chain disruptions and the regional impacts of COVID on our businesses. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, our commercial and operational execution has generated strong financial results and we expect this to continue in Q4 delivering earnings in the quarter close to last year.\nNow consistent with prior calls, I will provide a more detailed business specific outlook for the 4th quarter. Starting with Insulation, we expect year-over-year growth in our North American residential fiberglass insulation business and anticipate our volumes to be up mid to high single digits versus prior year. We expect price realization, similar to what we experienced in Q3. With the recently announced December increase having more impact as we get into the first quarter of next year.\nIn our technical and global insulation businesses, volumes should grow low to mid single digits with ongoing demand for our products in global building and construction applications. Similar to residential installation, we would expect price realization in these businesses to be similar to what we saw in Q3. In terms of inflation, we expect material and energy cost increases in the 4th quarter to be higher than what we experienced in Q3 and anticipate that continued price realization will result in a positive price cost mix in the quarter. Additionally, we expect our fixed cost absorption to improve by approximately $5 million versus prior year. Given all this, we expect to see strong earnings growth in Q4 versus prior year with EBIT margins of approximately 15%. Moving on to composites, in the 4th quarter, we expect revenue to improve year-over-year primarily driven by continued price realization and favorable mix which we would expect to more than offset volume declines of mid-single digits for the quarter. We anticipate composites pricing will improve by mid single digits offsetting the impact of additional inflation and that we should benefit from the recovery of $15 to $20 million of curtailment costs versus 4th quarter 2020.\nOverall, we expect to realize strong earnings growth in the quarter versus prior year with EBIT margins of approximately 14% and in roofing, we anticipate the market to finish up for the year, but expect a more difficult comparison to the 4th quarter of prior year with market volumes down mid-teens driven by the expectation for a more normal winter season,;ower storm demand and the likelihood of ongoing supply chain disruptions. We would expect our volumes to largely in line with the market. Roofing pricing is expected to be favorable in Q4 based on the continued realization of our previously announced price increases. Although, less than what we saw in Q3 due to the lower volumes. Additionally, in terms of revenue, we expect a headwind from mix in the quarter, similar to what we saw in Q3. Overall, we anticipate 4th quarter Roofing EBIT margins of approximately 20% on lower volumes and a narrowing but positive price cost mix.\nWith that, view of our businesses, I'll close with a couple of enterprise items. Our team remains committed to generating strong operating and free cash flow. In terms of capital allocation, our priorities remain focused on reinvesting in our business especially productivity and organic growth initiatives returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases and maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. In addition, we continue to evaluate investments and acquisitions that leverage our commercial, operational and geographic strengths and expand our building and construction material product and system offering.\nOne last note before moving on to the Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone, we will be hosting a virtual Investor Day on Wednesday. November 10th. Ken and I will be joined by members of our executive leadership team to discuss the company's strategic priorities, financial objectives and initiatives to drive long-term stakeholder value. Please reference the earnings press release for more details around this important event. We hope you will join us in 2 weeks. In closing, our team is proud of the outstanding operational and financial performance we delivered in the 3rd quarter and are excited by the opportunities we have to grow our company, help our customers win in the market and deliver value to our shareholders.\nWith that I will now turn the call back to Amber to open it up for questions. Amber."

      "speech": "Thank you, Brian. We are now ready to begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Matthew Bouley",
      "speech": "Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results here, operating in a pretty challenging environment. Just the question on the roofing business and particularly price. You gave that comment about price in Q4 being a little less than Q3 due to lower volumes. I'm just curious if that's the comment that pricing is actually slipping a little bit sequentially alongside lower volumes and really the broader question is if you do see volumes continue to normalize into 2022 how should we think about pricing alongside that. Thank you very much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Thanks, Matt for the comments and in the questions. Just let me clarify in roofing pricing, we expect in Q4, to continue to see good realization of our price points, so we're not things slip in the market. I think that was more commentary around total price realization being a little less just be based on lower volumes, not anything that would be a reflection on the strength of the pricing in the market today of our product. So we continue to see good realization expect that to continue into Q4, so in overall in terms of volumes. I think we'll probably talk more about this, but we see that volumes are going to be up on a year-over-year basis. I think what we're seeing here in Q3, a little bit in Q4, it's just a difficult comp comparison to last year where if you look at last year. Q2 is very low with COVID shutdowns and uncertainty in demand and we saw distribution build and buy a lot more in the back half of the year, we saw contractor work really increased dramatically as homeowners invested in home.\nSo I think we're still in a very strong roofing market overall. We're just seeing a little bit of comp comparisons in 3rd quarter and then that we're guiding to in Q4. So we think we're in a very strong market historically in our roofing business, we've been able to recover asphalt and other inflation through pricing actions over time. We've been able to demonstrate that for the last several quarters and we expect a good strong market, we'd be able to continue to operate in that fashion moving forward. [Operator Instructions]"

      "speaker": "Stephen Kim",
      "speech": "Thanks a lot, guys, good results. I wanted to ask a question about price mix, excuse me, generally across your business. I guess could you comment on sort of what is driving the relative mix effects across and I mean not kind of in terms, in percentage terms in insulation roofing as well as I think composites had some mixed benefit and then within the composite you also had some very nice price and historically, much of this segment has annual pricing contracts, which I think you alluded to, just curious as to what we saw in 3Q, how much of that was due to sort of spot pricing, if you will, in the segment versus successful renegotiations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Thanks, Stephen thanks for the question. Let's talk about composites first and then maybe we can talk about price mix across the business. You're correct, composites has driven another very strong quarter, delivering well and I think before answering the specific question, what I would say is, this is really the result of what we've been talking about for a couple of years, which is driving the business more toward higher value solutions for our customers and actually kind of with the environment that we're operating in today, which is a pretty high capacity utilization environment we're able to focus a bit more on those higher value applications because of the market demand is so strong.\nAs a result, what you're seeing is this mix benefit, which is as we deliver more of the higher value solutions that's falling out in our mix calculation and you're seeing shifting to those higher value applications and therefore driving positive mix. I think that's something that's here to stay. I mean I think that as we continue to shift the business that's really going to be a part of what we are continuing to focus on. You've seen it for the last couple of quarters and we would expect that to continue. On the price side, you're correct on that as well that we do have about 2/3rd of our Composites business, which is tied to 2 contracts and then I would say about a 3rd of it in general has tied the spot pricing. As we moved into 2021 when many of the contracts were in the process of being negotiated because some of them are annual contracts, we were moving into a strong demand environment and that allowed us to build in some good pricing dynamics within those contracts and then as we came into 2021 the situation even strengthen further. So what I would tell you is that on the pricing side, we are seeing the carry through positive contract price negotiations that came through from our negotiations last year.\nWe are also seeing equivalently good pricing on a spot basis and I think that comes from the fact that we are benefiting from what we call our local production for a local demand environment where within this environment, customers are really looking for good quality solutions that are readily and closely achievable geographically. So I think that benefit from pricing comes both from the contract negotiations, as well as from the spot pricing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Stephen Kim",
      "speech": "I guess if we look at price costs across the enterprise. I think if you go through our 3rd quarter results. You'd see we've probably maintained about a positive $50 million price cost mix across the enterprise. That's in each one of the businesses and that I think that is really attributed to I believe our team has just done a fantastic job of seeing these inflation trends as they have emerged throughout the year. We've recognized the impact and we've translated this into action, which delivered another positive price cost mix for the enterprise and in each one of the businesses. So in this inflationary environment that's what we're going to continue to need to do as we continue to look forward in terms of the inflation headwinds that we're seeing in Q4 and that unfortunately we think will probably continue into the first part of 2022. So I think the teams are executing well in terms of identifying it, seeing it, getting us in pricing actions and and I think our price realization is reflective of the value of our products and services that we're bringing to our customers.

      "speaker": "Yves Bromehead",
      "speech": "Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get a bit of a better understanding on the inflation, especially on the energy side with what's happening in in gas and other type of inputs in the US and Europe. Could you maybe help us to understand what's the sort of Owens Corning exposure to that and if there is any hedging strategy and if so, if that's more into Europe and more into the US any color on that would be appreciated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Yeah. Thanks, Yves. Great question, I mean I think we're all dealing with it. I think we're all talking through it and I think at Owens Corning we are obviously actively and proactively attempting to address it through what Brian just talked about which is constantly looking ahead at what we see in the inflation area and making sure that we have the appropriate pricing mechanisms in place to offset that. On energy, specifically the way that we are seeing at both. I would say, primarily in Europe and North America and we saw the 3rd quarter If I were to think about the first 3 quarters of the year. The 3rd quarter not surprisingly, was kind of where we have seen so far the most energy inflation impact and and we're kind of expecting that environment to continue through the 4th quarter.\nSo, second half of this year for energy inflation is actually where we expect to see the biggest and biggest impact versus the first couple of quarters. The way that we do manage it as we do have some hedges in place. Our hedges are primarily in Europe for energy and I would say in Europe overall, we probably hedge a bit more than probably the majority of the anticipated energy needs. We don't hedge in the United States, because we don't see that is quite a volatile market typically, but we do hedge in Europe and it is kind of at the majority of the spend we are hedging.

      "speaker": "Philip Ng",
      "speech": "Hey guys, congrats on a really impressive quarter in tough backdrop. I guess with growth flattening out a little bit in lap and tougher comps in roofing, there is this fear that you'll see a big correction in your performance next year. Your comments on Roofing sounds pretty benign here, but any color on channel inventory and when you see that normalizing this product still on allocation, and just how you're thinking about growth when you look at the 2022."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Yeah, thanks, Phil for your comments. I think overall, again I would characterize Roofing demand is remaining very strong. I think when we think about some of the tough comps we are lapping. I think another comment I'd make about our Q4 guide there is that even though we think we're going to be stepping down quite a bit mid teens versus last year. To put that in perspective, last year was a historic high and you really had the influence of really strong market demand, a lot of inventory that was trying to be rebuilt and strong storms and an unseasonably warm winter weather.\nSo I think when we talk about a guide stepping down from that, if I just look back at 4th quarter averages for 2017, 18 and 19, it averages out about $28 million square. So our guide in 4th quarter is about a mid-teens increase versus that kind of historic average. So I think while the guide is done on a comp basis, the strength overall in the market for roofing we see through continue through Q4 and frankly we think that's going to be setting up for a strong start to 2022 when we look at some of the fundamentals, we still see very strong contractor backlogs in our contractor network that we work with very closely.\nWe continue to see investments in home remodeling and repairs as consumers and homeowners continue to improve their home and their living spaces we see that trend continuing. We see storm demand kind of comping down year-over-year and you would see that in some of the market ARMA numbers like in the Midwest Rocky Mountains, but in the Southeast, Southwest other parts where storm have come through recently that's going to be a carryover that moves into 2022 and then as you said, I would characterize demand for our product is still very, very strong.\nWe are still producing and shipping everything we can make. I think distributor inventory levels are starting to get a little better depending on geography. I think it is very now getting to a regional story where inventory levels are getting a little better, but I would say overall, our inventory levels are very lean in our manufacturing sleeves, the demand for our products are very strong and I think in distribution. I think that inventory levels are being managed but I think distributors are probably being more selective now on the products, brands colors they are buying as we close out the year.\nSo I think some of that more distributors kind of prioritizing inventory levels and making product line choices are going to come through in some of the manufacturing shipments, but again I think this is against a backdrop of strong repair and remodeling, good storm demand still a good finish to the 4th quarter and then we think a good carryover that sets us up for a very good start to 2022 and again, we're seeing good price realization in the business against the inflation we're seeing.\nWe'll continue to monitor that, but we feel good given the demand environment, given the strength of our product line that will be able to continue to react to any increases in inflation as we go forward into 2022.

Let me tag along that Roofing and just ask you if you have any thoughts on the ARMA data that came out though is in a down 10% in the quarter. Your roofing pretty held up pretty nicely. That's one part of the question, second, can you talk to any benefits from Hurricane Ida and if you're able to quantify. I do appreciate that it translates to revenues later on, but you're probably seeing some orders coming in based on that so that's my first question."

      "speech": "Sure. Thanks. I think in regard to the 3rd quarter performance. Yeah ARMA down 10%. Again some of this is a bit of a comp for the market and for us. I think in the 3rd quarter, we did see in the roofing a little bit of variation regionally with some regions that saw some declines. I think tied to that. My comments are on kind of some lower storm demand and lower storm volumes on a year-over-year basis. I think we've seen that in kind of Midwest region from the Rocky Mountain region in that space, I think we've also seen some supply chain disruptions.\nWe've been able to minimize that but we've seen transportation bottlenecks. We saw a major transportation carrier that transports asphalt materials that exited and we're not a business in the quarter that I know impacted us and we think would have impacted others. We continue to hear about Matt supply tightness and we see that in our own business and in our own order book so I think there is some of those things that are impacting some of the manufacturing shipments relative to again a very strong market environment. I think for our performance, a couple of aspects that one is we were comping over last year, we would have lost a little bit of share.\nWe talked about that last year that we think other manufacturers had a lot more inventory in Q3 to ship from last year that did not occur this year. So we were comping to that and we expected, and I said at that time last year that we thought this was going to be just a bit of a timing issue on orders and we certainly saw that come through our order book this year as we maintain our share positions and good contract relationships. So I think we benefit from that. I think second thing is we benefit from a vertically integrated supply chain so we produce our own fibers, mat. We process our own asphalt on many of our sites. So I think we have a bit of an advantage there in terms of our vertically integrated supply chain that kind of came through in our ability to produce and ship in the quarter.\nSo again that's I think was more on Q3 on the market and our performance against the backdrop of good demand. I think in terms of the impact of Ida, we certainly have seen that repair work beginning to take place. It was a very sizable storm, I've seen some estimates out there of an impact of maybe 2 to 3 million squares in total. We would think it's probably more to the high side of that but because of the size and scale of the repairs, we'd expect to see the majority of this demand kind of get pushed into next year. So the work is beginning, but I think that's going to be a continuation into the first half of 2022 to get that work complete. [Operator Instructions]"

Can you talk about how you came to the decision around looking at the alternatives for the glass asset and I guess if this is just driven by market position or certain metrics like margins or ROI and I guess maybe why now the decision like if something happened to trigger the decision now versus decisions from a year or 2 ago. Thank you."

    {
      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Sure, thanks, thanks for the question. It is absolutely a market positioning decision. So I think over the past few years, you've heard me talk a lot about our focus within composites to build out a very flexible, cost-effective manufacturing network, investments in automation we've made, investments in-process controls and productivity and we see that coming through in our results that Ken talked about. I think the other aspect commercially as we've been focused on growing in higher value materials solutions where we can differentiate with our innovation and specification work and we've talked about areas of focus for us in composites around building and construction applications, renewable energy infrastructure.\nThese are applications that we're doing very well and continue to invest and grow. So I'm looking at our Dutch product line and this is a chopped fiber that gets mix with resins and used in automotive applications and electronic small appliances. It's a good business for us, but we don't believe that we have a market-leading position in the business and it would require significant investment to build that. So it's not a reflection of our talent or teams or our product positions or manufacturing capabilities.\nIt's really a strategic decision we've made to focus our investments in other areas of composites, where we see higher growth opportunities for us and that fits within our enterprise strategy to build and expand our building and construction material offering. So we made the decision, we thought now is the right time to do it. Our evaluation and process will really focus on either divesting the business or repurposing those manufacturing assets to produce other composite products that we see fitting into our strategy going forward and give us better growth and margin opportunity going forward.\nSo we'll be working through that process over the next several months, but that was really a driver of being just evaluate and where we're at as a market leader and I'd say, I'd probably add that's consistent with kind of how we look at things continuously within the company and we assess our product positions, we assess our market positions, we assess the investments to build and grow and make these choices and and we just felt now was the right time to make this decision around the Dutch product line in moving forward with the composites in the company's strategy."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Yeah, thanks, Garik, I mean, as we've been talking about, we are certainly operating in an inflationary environment and we continue to monitor these inflation headwinds and evaluate impact and make these decisions in terms of how we offset these increasing costs that and looking at the insulation business and other businesses are pretty consistent process but its insualtion that led us to need to announce another increase frst part of December, which will come out.\nWe think it is needed relative to the input costs we're carrying and we think given the demand strength andthe market conditions that are going forward, we believe it's the right time to announce this to give our customers enough visibility so that they can start building that into their plans for 2022 as they sell and service builders in the market. So I think the market in insulation remains very strong, we continue to see good strength in the housing construction market. We think that's going to continue. We think demand for our products are going to continue to service the growing housing construction marketplace. So we feel like we've delivered good realization of the previously announced price increases throughout this year and feel given the demand environment, given the strength of our product offering that we feel like we are in a good position to see realization from this increase.

      "speaker": "Michael Rehaut",
      "speech": "Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping if you could give us a sense across each of your businesses, kind of an update on where inventory levels are in their respective channels obviously through most of this year inventory have been pretty tightand many product categories have been on allocation, I believe, in particular insulation. If you could give us any update in terms of again just where inventory levels are, if you're still rebuilding them. if they've started to increase on their own we've heard, for example in roofing that inventory is starting to come up in the channel and how our lead times and if anything is still on allocation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brian Chambers",
      "speech": "Yeah, thanks, Mike, my general question is going to be, we continue to see very lean inventories and low inventories across many of our customers and most of our product lines and I then would add the inventory levels that we carry as a company across most of our product lines are also very lean historically. So I think we are in process of just getting started about seeing some rebuild in both our inventory levels and distribution level inventory level. So I think that would be a very broad statement.\nI think within if I just kind of walk through the businesses within roofing you talked about, our inventory levels in our roofing materials remains very lean. We continue to produce as much as we can and we're shipping everything we can produce and at that point to service the customer demand. So I think broadly speaking in the roofing markets and channels, we're probably seeing a little bit of inventory build but again, I think it's very geographic specific relative to end market and out the door sales and it's very specific to product lines and colors.\nSo I think certain product lines, certain brands, certain colors are probably starting to see a little bit of rebuild. We are not seeing that in our product line. I think in insulation RES I think we continue to see we run with very lean inventories. So any kind of supply disruption kind of comes through in our ability to service our customers, unfortunately, but we are committed to continuing to produce as much as we can. We've talked about some of the capacity adds that we brought on, and the changes we're making going into next year. So we continue to try to produce more quarter over quarter to service that business, but our inventory levels remain lean and we think customer channel inventories for the most part for RES insulation products are also historically low. I think on the technical insulation side, again a mixed bag but generally, the main thing would be the same, which is out the door sales, strong inventory levels, light and certainly inventory levels for us very, very low historically and I think then moving to composites can kind of cut short on composites."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Yeah, and the story is not going to be that much difference in fact what I would tell you is that, if you think about year-over-year as we kind of move from the second quarter to the 3rd quarter of last year on the composite side of the portfolio, we moved into a quarter with a pretty good amount of inventory on hand and then the the end markets started to step up pretty significantly in the second half of 2020, so what we saw is actually the ability to produce and deliver all of that product as well as to deliver product from on-hand inventory. Then as we move through 2021, we're kind of working at a pretty high capacity utilization level with good production levels in delivering products, but we are in the same situation as Brian is talking about on Roofing and Insulation, which is, we're pretty much delivering everything that we are producing within a quarter and so our inventory levels remain relatively low and I would say that overall composites inventory levels at the end of the 3rd quarter probably actually still continue to be net lower than they were at the end of 2020.\nSo we still have the ability, as we move through the rest of 2021 into 2022 to have the opportunity to kind of start to replenish those inventory levels but running pretty lean still just like we are in insulation and roofing.

      "speaker": "Truman Patterson",
      "speech": "Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch a little bit further on the US residential insulation business. It sounds like you all are still running at full capacity inventories. Excuse me. Inventories are pretty lean but you all have some moving parts with your capacity coming online and offline over the next year or 2. Builders have a pretty large backlog of homes and assuming that starts continue moving north in 2022 just wanting to understand yours capacity to actually service some of that demand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Thanks for the question Truman. I think we feel overall in a very good spot to service the demand environment that we have in front of us today and with some of the consensus estimates for housing starts are as we go into 2022. We've said the moves we are making we continue to focus on just building a very flexible, cost-efficient network that gives us the opportunity to continue to bring additional capacity to the market cost effectively, but also gives us the flexibility in any kind of cycle turns to operate a very cost efficient network. So I think we continue to balance that.\nI think all the moves. We've made, though, as I've talked about we're going to produce significantly more insulation volumes this year than last. We expect to be able to produce more inflation volumes next year than this year with the capacity moves and changes and all those are moving forward in line with what I talked about last quarter. In terms of, we've got the Eloi manufacturing facility that we expect to bring up here in the first quarter. We've got to work with [Indecipherable] coming up kind of 3rd quarter next year. So we feel like we're in a good spot with those capacity adds coming on. We are in a very good spot in our productivity and process improvements and investments in automation that continues to give us more throughput through our existing footprint, which is a key part of our strategy.\nSo I think all of that work. I think kind of services a market in this up to $1.6 million housing starts environment we're operating in today. I think we also do have the ability to bring on some step change capacity adds that we could do that very cost-effectively, we can do that very timely. I think what we would need to see is probably a step change though in housing starts beyond the 1.6 as we think about additional capacity. But right now I think we continue to feel good about our production increases quarter-over-quarter and we think that it's going to continue going forward. So we feel like we can get caught up with servicing this kind of market environment, get back to more traditional lead times in our product categories, but again this is something we assess continuously and if we feel like we're in a position where we need to bring on some additional capacity, we certainly have the levers to pull to do that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Parks",
      "speech": "Sure. Keith, thanks, thanks for the question. The mix impact. We saw in Q3 is really within our components segment. So as we've talked about in the past, we continue to grow and build around the roofing components that go into the system to build out the roof. So these are going to be underlayments and ventilation products and hip and routes and start all those pieces and parts that that go into installing the roof and in our components business, we had 2 particular product lines Hip and Ridge and Starter that are more attributed to our Owens Corning Shingles. So the rest of our components offering can be used under other shingle manufacturers or other types of roofing products.\nHipper region start is a little bit more specific to matching with the Owens Corning product line. So I think in the first part of the year, we saw distribution just buying a lot of both shingles and component materials to kind of try to service the market. I think what we saw in Q3 was again distributors, just kind of rebalancing inventory levels of our hip and ridge and starter products relative to our Shingle inventories and we saw that create a bit of a mix headwind with those inventory decisions and we would expect that that is going to be kind of similar next in Q4. If we look at the year-over-year comps in terms of how much hip and ridge and starter was bought last year in 4th quarter versus what we think is going to be bought this year relative to our shingle shipments.\nSo I don't think there is no structural issues around our mix or around our components offering. I think guess it is just a bit of timing issue and a rebalancing of our hip and ridge and starter products relative to our shingle products in the distribution inventory that impacted Q3 and we expect the impact in Q4.

I think we'll get more into our 2022 outlooks, when we get on our next quarterly call but I'd say, overall we feel like we're set up to start 2022 in a very strong position across the enterprise, we've talked about Roofing demand and the strength of the markets and some carryover that we think move into 2002. We've talked about inflation on the red side. Housing starts continue to stay strong on the technical and global inflation businesses, we see growing commercial demand and project work that's increasing volumes and we're starting to get some good price realization and then in Composites. I think our focus in these higher value kind of multi-material systems and solutions around building construction renewable energy infrastructure. I think we see great secular growth trends that impact housing, that impact that need for more sustainable solutions of focus on energy efficiency, a focus on infrastructure investments.\nSo I think all of those kinds of big secular trends I think sort of very well relative to our product offering today, and where we're investing to grow going forward. So I think right now, we'd say we're set up as a company very well to continue to be able to grow our revenues and continue to generate really good earnings and cash flow. So I think we're pretty optimistic as we sit here today in terms of how we're positioned in the Company going forward, and the market trends in key secular growth trends we're seeing that setup very well for us.

      "speech": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the patience with the technical difficulties this morning. Welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations, and joining me is Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today.\nBefore we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide two for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a company strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights, and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente."

      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. And as you can see on Slide 3, anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear three key themes today: First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for our shareholders; second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance, which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working; and third, we will touch on our ESG journey.\nI have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners, and the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. Moving to Slide 4. Our five strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2, we have achieved substantial traction in all five imperatives.\nWithin our operate sustainably strategic imperative, we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. Moving to Slide 5. A couple of weeks ago, we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data, celebrates our progress and details our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday, during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is the team's strong bias for action over the last year, as you can see on this page.\nWe have focus and deliver on diversity within our Board and extended leadership team, which is now 50% and 43%, respectively. We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improve our new product development process to address these goals. We expanded a stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to our employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company.\nWe see broad-based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase our earnings on wealth if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. Moving to Slide 6. The signing of definitive agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the Precision and Science Technologies segment, a representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy.\nSeepex is, by our estimation, the #2 global progressive cavity pump manufacturer, and it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader, player in the agritech software and controls market. With technology, we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single-digit to double-digit organic growth since at least lease 2017, and our focus on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. In addition, both have strong aftermarket profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service.\nWe anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year three of ownership. With these two acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of this high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel, which leads us to Slide 7. We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX at its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of six stages and its probability-weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel size.\nFor instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged, and we were in active negotiation that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assigning. And now it is out of our funnel calculation. Last quarter, we described how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At its current state, the funnel size remains approximately 5 times the size it was versus Q2 of 2020, with average revenue larger and velocity accelerating minutely. And to be clear, this describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter as well as our signed deals of Seepex and Maximus, and it also excludes SPX Flow.\nAs you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel but our flywheel is in full motion. Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was pre-emptive, and fully accounted for SPX Flow's Investor Day plan, which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative presence, if we participate, we intend to remain disciplined in our approach as we do with all of our M&A transactions, and there can be no assurances that we will confirm our pre-emptive offer as part of any such process.\nIt is important -- it is very important also to note that when we received the second rejection from SPX Flow more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. We have always demonstrated a very decisive and highly disciplined approach with everything we do. And we believe it is much more important now in this current environment.\nAs stated, even with SPX Flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash on hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our Board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year.\nI'll now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance."

      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020 are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID, we think comparing this performance in 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving.\nAnd we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 were up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company, eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment acquisition remains intact as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million, a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%, a 160 basis point improvement year-over-year.\nOne item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solutions segment or the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2 with relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2 times, a 1.7 times improvement from Q1. Turning to Slide 9.\nFor the total company, orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q3 and beyond. The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments.\nWe expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable levels in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. capex during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments.\nAs is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in flows from continuing operations due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials, including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we are calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 0.2 times, which is a 1.7 times improvement as compared to prior quarter, and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures.\nWe expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021, and if you were to pro forma the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows, leverage would have been closer to 0.6 times. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 11.\nWe continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or are in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. As a reminder and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year.\nWe expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022.\nOn the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we have seen on the cost side, largely coming from direct material and logistics as well as some of the expected return of onetime and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total year basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year.\nIn addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape, particularly with regards to inflation, and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first half.\nI will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments."

      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Thank you, Vik. And moving to Slide 12. Starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin of 34%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the mid-40%.\nA further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong at up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid-70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50%, while India, Middle East, saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific.\nFrom a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid-40s, on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. In power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio.\nIn this case, during Q2, we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. That's a bit of a background. The basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant. Does the water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil-lubricated and oil-free air compression technology. So it is a great adjacent technology that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer.\nThis is a very important requirement, especially in oil-free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. It is also good to note that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed at [Indecipherable], which was accompanied owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products [Indecipherable], but we're now leveraging the technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers.\nThe even more exciting piece here is that we're doing this while helping the environment. This new driver portfolio is 20% more energy-efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. Moving to Slide 13 and the Precision and Science Technology segment, overall, organic orders were up 20% driven by, i.e., the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serve lab, life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Milton Roy product lines.\nThe momentum in our Haskel Hydrogen Solution business continues to build, and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 12% (sic) [13%] organically, which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q2 2020 for the Medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 33%.\nToday, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high-pressure technology, and we're now ready to capture the growth in this business. We have line of sight to about $45 million in organic investments over the next five years to both build out our capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space, with approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months.\nSince our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3 times to over $250 million in potential projects. And we still feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand two of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the power and remote joint venture. Moving to Slide 14. Given the comp performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the High Pressure Solutions and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segments as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus.\nOur prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of high single-digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now open guiding up to be mid-teens in total with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance.\nFX is expected to continue to be a low single-digit tailwind, and based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from power guidance at the midpoint of the range. We also highlight that these also includes the increased corporate cost of approximately $6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance, as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. capex is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue.\nAnd finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20%, and this does include a $35 million benefit due to a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate with the balance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Slide 15. As we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand brand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. To our employees, I want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take our role as sustainably minded industry leader seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mike Halloran",
      "speech": "Hey. Good morning, everyone. I'm with Baird. Thanks for taking the question. Just focusing on the supply chains, inflation pressures, component shortages, things like that, maybe some thoughts on how that's impacting results in the second quarter and how you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters? When does normalization start materializing? And how are you thinking about that price-cost equation internally?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, Mike. Good morning. We definitely continue to see price cost equation to be positive even here in the second half. As you might recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up in Q4 of 2020, and we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of the year, we have seen inflation, and we call inflation here direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions.\nI'll say those pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind, but generally stabilizing.\nWhile logistics side we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half, but this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. And then there beyond as things materialize, and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mike Halloran",
      "speech": "And then a follow-up is, obviously, good momentum in the quarter, underlying trends are healthy. what are the customers saying about sustainability at this point, large versus small sized projects or maybe OE versus run rate? How are those tracking? And what is the visibility in the capex reinvigoration as you're thinking forward? And again, what are customers saying about that topic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, Mike. I think, if anything, what we saw is that, as you know, we have some long cycle businesses, particularly kind of that Nash/Garo and some of the large compressors. And we saw in the second quarter order momentum to continue to improve compared to the first half. We actually saw orders accelerating on these large projects.\nSo maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feeling more confident and comfortable about releasing capex for some of these large projects. And so at least in our view, that's kind of good news. We also see, as I mentioned, good funnel momentum building on some of these kind of hydrogen refueling networks, which, obviously -- that tends to create some good solid investments here that turn into revenue for our business"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Julian Mitchell",
      "speech": "Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start on acquisitions. I mean I think you've made it clear with flow that you won't aggressively chase that. Maybe on the announced transactions, maybe help us understand as you're thinking about sort of full year EBITDA accretion first 12 months or 2022 from Seepex and Maximus combined, what sort of number roughly should we be expecting there? And also Seepex margins. I think you're assuming that you can move those up quite substantially over several years. Maybe help lay out sort of some of the big moving parts within that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, Julian, thanks. We're really excited with these two pending acquisitions. And we actually see both companies as we kind of go ahead and look into next year to be continuing to grow low double-digit top line as we kind of have stated, Maximus is already at the Precision and Science Technology margin profile.\nSo -- and Seepex, even though below, we expect that Seepex, as we go into 2022, will be kind of the low 20% margin. And as you would expect, this is our initial view, and we have already launched an IDM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process as we kind of move now into the next phase of closing the deal and moving into the integration. So far, what we see is that we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins to the Precision and Science level.\nI think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring aftermarket. It has already launched a very meaningful, or what we consider to be really strong digital platform, where they've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for these type of pumps, which tend to be highly cost-effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex. I mean as it brings to the table not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps but also a great IoT technology. And clearly, same thing with Maximus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Julian Mitchell",
      "speech": "Thank you. And then just my second question around sort of near-term margin dynamics in the base business. So I think looking at Slide 11, you called out less of a margin increase in the second half year-on-year than the first half. So completely understand that. But the implied sort of incremental margins still look pretty high in the sort of mid-30s plus in the second half year-on-year. Just wanted to make sure that's roughly correct. And whether you think that's appropriately sort of conservative given that backdrop of higher corporate costs, price cost pressures and so forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "Yes. Hi, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that one. So yes, I mean, I think, first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year, as we mentioned, and I think actually even the left side of that page kind of highlights. Despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we have been seeing, you've seen, I'd say, a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to. I'd say, we've talked about this historically from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this and obviously, the first half of the year was no different.\nSo I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking toward the back half of last year as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year, I think that, obviously, continued to allow us to keep the price-cost equation on the positive side. And then the other piece is, obviously, we 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interestingly enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side.\nSo you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half of the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we will continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit, to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeff Sprague",
      "speech": "Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey Vicente, can you give a little bit more color on the funnel that you've really built here on the M&A side? First, I would imagine the vast majority of it is in PST, would -- could you kind of confirm or elaborate on that? And also, just interested if there's any common theme on what you're actually passing on, would it just primarily be valuation? I would imagine that were in the funnel because they've got some interesting attributes, right? Or they wouldn't have been there to begin with. So it's just kind of a valuation dynamic or as you dug deeper into these, you just find like some of the synergy opportunities are what you would have hoped."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, sure, Jeff. So I'd say on the funnel, to answer your question, it's kind of almost like a 60-40, so 60% more in the PST, 40% on still ITS. So we still see some good kind of momentum here on the ITS side. I will say that the characteristics right now on our funnel that they're largely bolt-on in nature with some medium to large size targets as well. And -- but nothing that I will describe as kind of transformational in nature. I will also describe them as great companies.\nAnd by that, I mean highly recognized brands, market leader, good gross margin, but that we can see a path to improve and we continue to be prudent and seeing that ROIC can be achieved in the mid-teens by year 3. So with that in mind, yes, I mean, you're absolutely right in terms of the -- one of the common themes of passing is valuation. But I'll say that it kind of varies. Valuation is an important threshold in how we screen deals against our financial metrics.\nBut we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectations of ongoing COVID-related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by [discounting] it. So I think it just speaks a lot about the solid process that we have in terms of our diligence that it's not only looking at businesses, but we do a lot of market work, including voice of customer and interviews to ensure that we understand market trends and commercial possibilities."

      "speaker": "Jeff Sprague",
      "speech": "And then a separate unrelated question, just on kind of the energy efficiency push going on across the product offering. Just wondering to what extent do you actually see this as a retrofit driver where companies looking to kind of prove their ESG profile are actually willing to kind of rip and replace functional equipment in the name of efficiency. Or should we really just think about the energy efficiency new products is really just the basis of competition on new business or kind of regular replacement business?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, Jeff, it's a really interesting question. I will say that we see a lot of retrofitting driver because in many instances -- and we have said some of this before, when you look at a blower that goes into a wastewater treatment facility, the energy consumed by a blower is close to like 60% of the energy consumer at that total facility. So these are devices that are highly mission-critical, low cost to the overall process when you put in perspective when a purchase -- when you buy the product.\nBut they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors. And a lot of our compressor -- new compressor technology is just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. So in many cases, we have trained our sales teams, our commercial teams to really sell on that value proposition.\nAnd this is what we see as one of the main drivers when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient. And with energy continue to increase in countries like -- or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption."

That's on top of, I think, the growth quarter in 2Q '20 as well. So it wasn't an easy comp. So curious, number one, what you're seeing in China, there's some concerns of hard-ish landing? And then maybe how your share is trending in China? Obviously, you're up against a very strong competitor in that market."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, we're very pleased with what the team in China continues to do. I can say that even about a year ago, when COVID hit really hard in China, the team immediately started to pivot into end markets where they could see meaningful growth as the recovery from the China economy will come. And we're seeing a lot of that now, that pivoting into better end markets that are end markets where government is putting some good investments. I'll say that also, the team has done some really great product launches.\nThe team overall, they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors. It is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before our blower and vacuum business was actually fairly small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with the Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. And one example that I show even here today with these air treatment, air treatment revenue right now in China is very low.\nSo this is a really meaningful opportunity for the team in China as we kind of take this new product line of dryer solutions and launched that -- and kind of launch that in China. So a really good combination of the teams executing really well, commercially selling what we have in different end markets, while at the same time, launching new products that are really getting good traction in the market."

And some of your kind of peer industrial companies are pushing out some of the kind of supply chain cost savings that they're targeting because of the pressures that we're seeing right now.\nAre you seeing some of that as well? Are some of these projects moving to the right? And then within that as well, the inflation that you're seeing in the supply chain, is that $100 million bucket? I know it's not all supply chain, but is that net of inflation? Or is the inflation outside of that bucket?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "Yes. I'll answer probably backwards, frankly, so to start with your second question. They're kind of distinct. So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the $100 million of total synergies, of which, obviously, the -- I'd say, the procurement direct material component comprises a big component of. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before. Even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say, $100 million expectation of synergies and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation. Clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit.\nBut those two numbers are somewhat distinct, and that's the way we're kind of managing it. Clearly, our teams have done a really great job. When you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, I'd say, their attention between both synergy delivery as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general market has seen.\nSo I think right now, we're extremely pleased. Are we seeing any dramatic pushout of savings or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner. I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of an acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate.\nSo like we said, we're not immune to what's going on, but I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought and also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants."

      "speech": "Hello and thank you. I had a couple of questions just on the acquisition funnel. And then one is just on Maximus. I'm curious if the IoT aspect and the growth are a little bit different in that asset and whether the connectivity IoT or finding the way into the backlog or in the acquisition funnel in a more meaningful way? And how do you think about transforming that opportunity via acquisition versus what you're also doing through your installed base?\nAnd the second one, if I may just do them both at once, is just, obviously, if you do a large deal, you replaced some of the revenue disappearance from Specialty Vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about it that way. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes. Thanks, Rob. On the Maximus IoT growth, that is a phenomenal find in terms of an acquisition, and that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron that plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market. It is the market-leading nonelectrical pumps. So it basically creates dosing and movement of water just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology.\nAnd in most of these kind of highly specialized applications, you can think about those applications like hydroponics. I mean we know demand after the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more, you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics, which is, obviously, the way of growing vegetables with the use of water.\nAnd here, we have a really great leadership position. So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is -- Maximus is the leader in this agritech controlling aspects of being able to control the entire ecosystem of that and where we see a lot of very good place of not only our pumps, but other devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other air markets?\nThat is what our thesis also goes into is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets. And that's where we just get super excited. And in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals. That's what many say.\nI will say that with the use of IRX right now, we'll be building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating a small or bolt-on deal, it goes actually quite well. I mean Tuthill or -- and the Kenny is a great example where the team in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost-effective way. So do we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale?\nYes, but we also know that larger deals come in with, what I call, a bit of hair in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of the couple of businesses that you may not like from those systems -- from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on and medium-size business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals."

    {
      "speaker": "Joe Ritchie",
      "speech": "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Vicente, I know we've talked a lot about the M&A funnel. But just quick question. As you're kind of thinking through the types of opportunities, are you looking more for kind of fixer uppers where you can utilize the IRX system to really drive better margin expansion? Or is there like a good balance of maybe margin accretive type acquisitions that you're looking at as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "No. I think, Joe, I -- we're looking for businesses that can continue to raise the bar of Ingersoll Rand in the sense of making Ingersoll Rand continue to be a great -- I'll take it from a good company to a great company, but also even making it a greater company. And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio, that makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top line growth for the future value of the company.\nSeepex and Maximus are kind of 2, I would say, great businesses that, for example, are growing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of Precision and Science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that, in some cases, we look at both. But more important is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company a better so we can continue to see multiple accretion in our overall business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Joe Ritchie",
      "speech": "Got it. That's helpful context. And then I guess maybe just my follow-on question. You referenced the book-to-bill earlier. I think you guys were at like 1.14 for total company. If I take a look at your order trends for the first half of the year versus revenue, I think, you're up about $350 million.\nIs the way to think about this going forward that you're booking more kind of like mid-cycle type work at this point? And that's why you're going to have to play catch up on the revenue side with your order rates? Or how should we be kind of thinking about how revenue and orders kind of converge over the next, call it, 12 to 24 months?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "Yes, Joe, this is Vik. I'll take that one. So I think, first and almost, yes, I mean, we've, obviously, been really pleased with the orders performance. I think the good thing here that we've talked about and Vicente mentioned is, in the second quarter, we actually saw a good mix of what we'll call kind of core compressor blower, vacuum-type orders, which, yes, typically ship out within kind of the next quarter thereafter. You're not typically booking those for 5, six months out in most regions.\nBut we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the kind of the larger project side, whether that be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be the Nash/Garo business. So I'd say those are the types of orders that tend to have a six to 12 in certain cases, even longer than that kind of order-to-sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is we've seen a bit of a balance.\nSo I think in the context of orders to revenue, yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog. I think we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in. Backlogs are up strong double digits and, frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio.\nBut the good news here is we've also taken some really nice longer cycle orders as we would call them, that kind of now even extend into 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of the last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer, Joe."

      "speech": "Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe I'll just follow up on that question just now. If I look at the last capex spending cycle from '16, '17, '18 and I look at sort of the former [Indecipherable] investors, Gardner Denver in the growth there. It was interesting to see that both companies are actually at the top of the sector pretty much among the top in terms of that growth inflection.\nIs that something in the context of what you just mentioned around sort of short cycle, long cycle, et cetera, that we should use as a framework maybe for the next 2, three years, if we assume that we are at a similar point in the capex cycle? Just trying to get a sense for sort of this long-cycle business side and how much of the short-cycle business is short cycle in nature, but ultimately driven by capex."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, Markus, I think, that's probably a good analogy. You get to see -- to think that at least what we see here is this kind of broad-based optimism in the market and that capex are kind of getting more and more getting started to get released. And so yes, you could argue that, that's kind of the same type of momentum that we expect to see."

    {
      "speaker": "Markus Mittermaier",
      "speech": "Great. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on hydrogen. You've mentioned sort of a 250 million funnel. How should we think about sort of the timing on the conversion of that funnel and ultimately how fragmented is that market? If you look at that 2.5 billion opportunity by 2027, what do you think that market looks like 3, 4, five years down the road?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vicente Reynal",
      "speech": "Yes, in terms of the fragmentation is, there are actually not that many players in the dispensing market. You could argue that there's kind of like top three main players with us being one of them. So at this point in time, it is such a highly specialized way of dispensing this type of gas and you have to do it with specialized type of equipment.\nAnd in this case, Haskel is one of the leading providers for doing that. And Haskel has a lot of history on dispensing hydrogen because they used to do a lot of this for rocket ships many, I mean, decades ago. And in terms of the $250 million funnel, I mean we see this over the next horizon of years. I mean it varies on project to project. But I think the good thing is to be -- continue to see that funnel momentum increase and get spec on many of these projects that are seeing expansion of networks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "And Markus, I would add to that, that frankly, given that funnel and given where our technology is headed, that's driving, obviously, the investment that we announced, the $10 million that we expect to spend over the next or so months, that's really meant to build out capacity in a large part here with the expectation to be able to execute on a meaningful part of that funnel.\nSo I think we're kind of seeing the funnel and we're reacting. And we said quite explicitly, we're going to continue to invest in those higher growth, organic growth areas this being a big one. And we're quite excited about a couple of the plant expansions that are going to be coming up here in Europe in the next 12 months."

      "speech": "Yes. Hi there. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one question from me. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the free cash flow build in the second half of the year? I don't know if there's some type of bridge you could talk a little bit about or maybe help us dial in on what greater than 100 means because obviously, very strong conversion and you're usually back half weighted. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Vik Kini",
      "speech": "Yes, John, you're exactly right. I think the free cash flow side of the equation typically tends to be a bit more second half seasonally weighted. That comes from probably a couple of different factors. One is, one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back-end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile. You've seen that in most years. I would also say the working capital side of the equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path.\nThis year will probably be no exception here where -- as you can see in the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year. A lot of that is positioned quite frankly, for the second half execution, second half orders. And so we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year. That tends to be, I would say, the kind of the two of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that we've been working really hard steadily on the tax rate.\nWe continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continue to see moving into '22 as well. So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent, continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But again, we'd expect to see a second -- strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year."

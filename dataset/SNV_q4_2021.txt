      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Thank you, Cal, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I want to take a moment to officially recognize Cal Evans and his new role as investor relations and market intelligence senior director. Cal expanded role in our company became official shortly after last quarter's call when Kevin Brown, who led IR for the past two years, shifted to our corporate treasury team.\nKevin has done a great job interfacing with our analysts and investor community, but his latest move will help with his development and career aspirations. Cal has hit the ground running and brings a lot to the table given his credit and market intelligence background. The transition is going well, and I know you will enjoy working with and getting to know Cal. Now let's shift into the overview of 2021.\nWith the fourth quarter placing an exclamation point on the year. 2021 was again wrought with challenges and uncertainties. But our teams were able to navigate the difficult environment to support our clients, contribute to our communities, and deliver for our shareholders. I want to thank our team for their hard work, dedication, and commitment.\nAs you'll hear today, we accomplished a lot, even as the pandemic continued to impact the operations of our clients and of our company. Our team is capable and understands the assignment when it comes to meeting the challenge from the unexpected and anticipating opportunities with and for our clients. Our strong fourth quarter and year-end report is an absolute testament to your talents and passions for the inspired and purpose-driven work we do that enables people to achieve their full potential. What you'll see today is a story of execution and follow-through of doing what we said we could and would do, and in many areas doing even more.\nAs we began 2021, we focused on five core business objectives. Number one, to regain growth momentum. Two, to enhance the client experience by making it even easier to do business with Synovus. Number three, to provide seamless delivery of our solutions across all of our lines of business, leading to a deeper wallet share and client relationships.\nFour, to better leverage analytics in order to provide more informed and proactive advice. And five, the development and attraction of talent to support our growth initiatives. We have made significant progress in all five core areas, and our success in 2021 was largely driven by our execution of these business objectives. Moving to Slide 3, let's review the year.\nOur lines of business succeeded in delivering core performance via a solid loan, deposit, and fee income growth, while client loan demand was muted in the first half of 2021, in the second half, we saw double-digit, broad-based commercial loan growth, driven primarily by our wholesale bank. With all 10 wholesale sub-lines of business posting growth for the year. 2021 funded commercial loan production increased 50% versus 2020 and was up 40% versus 2019. With significant productivity gains across our community and wholesale teams.\nWe expect this momentum to continue into 2022 given the pipelines and activities of our bankers, as well as the incremental growth that will be provided by our key 2021 investments and talent in the middle market, restaurant services, and corporate and investment banking teams. Deposit growth was driven by continued balance augmentation, as well as an ongoing sales focus on core operating accounts. As a result, core transaction balances have increased 57% in the past two years. We have strategically allowed higher-cost, lower-value deposits to attrite with an overarching goal of remixing our funding profile to optimize lower-cost deposit composition, during this period of excess liquidity.\nAt year-end, 77% of total deposits were core transaction deposits versus 70% at year-end 2020. Ex-security gains non-interest revenues grew 5%, led by increases in core banking fees and income from various wealth businesses. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of increases in wealth fees. Drivers of this growth include a strong equity market, as well as net new assets under management from client growth, including the onboarding of 12 new family office clients during the year.\nIn 2021, we continue to make significant progress with Synovus forward initiatives. As of year-end, we have achieved $110 million in pre-tax run-rate benefit ahead of our original projections. Evidence of success includes reducing real estate expenses, lowering headcount, and a reduction of third-party spending, all of which resulted in adjusted 2021 expenses being flat versus 2020. The Synovus forward savings allowed us to make strategic and impactful investments in every area while managing overall expenses.\nThis year, we will transition our Synovus forward efforts into our overall strategic plan but remain committed and on pace to achieve the $175 million Synovus forward target. As part of our focus on innovation, we launched several new digital solutions and services, including enhanced deposit, online account origination, accelerate AR, our integrated receivables suite, and gateway, our commercial banking digital platform. These investments have enhanced capabilities and functionality and are leading to a better overall client experience. We also implemented the smart commercial analytics tool that is giving our bankers better insights into solutions, our client's needs, early warning on client attrition, and proactive risk monitoring.\nIn 2021, we also invested in people. In particular, those who have experience and expertise to expand our advisory services and to build strong relationship value. We grew our treasury and payments team, which had another record-breaking year, growing sales by almost 40% and adding to specialty banking our middle market talent, and our high growth central and west Florida regions. We also continued to emphasize the development of our existing team members through the launch of two new leadership development tracks for emerging and senior leaders.\nDespite the challenges associated with the pandemic, our recent voice of the team member survey indicated that 84% of our team members were actively engaged, which is top quartile relative to the financial services benchmark, and we have designated a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute. We also have made measured progress in our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by meeting our short-term ethnicity and gender-based goals, and the leadership ranks in 2021. So overall, a productive and rewarding year and one that carries a tremendous amount of momentum into 2022. Now let me shift the highlights from the fourth quarter.\nLet's start on Slide 4 with loan growth, which increased $1.4 billion or an annualized 14% excluding P3. The growth this quarter resulted from our second consecutive quarter of record-funded commercial loan production at $3.2 billion. This represented a 30% increase from the third quarter. The quality of growth as measured by risk ratings and underwriting metrics is consistent with the existing portfolio, which continues to perform well and is supported by the reversal of credit losses of $55 million this quarter.\nIt's a similar story on the other side of the balance sheet, with core transaction deposit growth of $1.3 billion or 4% versus the third quarter. Approximately 30% of this quarter's increase came from non-interest-bearing deposits. The combination of balance augmentation and new account origination continues to be the drivers of growth. Net interest income growth was also strong this quarter, as we delivered $1.7 billion in earning asset growth.\nNet interest income increased by $16 million from the third quarter or 4%, excluding the reduction in P.3 fees. The net interest margin declined five basis points in the quarter, largely due to lower P3 income. But the NIM before PPP fees actually increased one basis point as earning asset yields were fairly stable and we continue to lower deposit rates during the quarter. From a fee income perspective, we continue to be pleased with overall performance as the fourth quarter totaled $117 million.\nCore banking fees have returned and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, as card and cash management income have more than offset reductions and NSF income. And our core strategic segments such as wealth management, continue to generate growth through AUM expansion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.31 or $1.35 on an adjusted basis and increased from $0.96 or $1.08 adjusted per share from the same period in 2020. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed our capital plan with $33 million of share repurchases.\nFor the full year, we balanced core client loan growth, a common dividend, and $200 million in share repurchases to achieve our target CET1 ratio of 9.5% at year-end, which represents the middle of our operating range target for the upcoming year. Jamie will now share greater detail on the key initiatives and financial results for the quarter."

      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Thank you, Kevin. I'll begin on Slide 5. We ended the year with total assets of $57.3 billion and loans of $39.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, total loans, excluding PPP balances, were up $1.4 billion, or 4% from the prior quarter, bolstered by strong commercial loan growth.\nThe commercial growth was broad-based across businesses, asset classes, and markets, and included robust production in several of our key business lines, such as structured finance, senior housing, national accounts, and commercial banking. The positive momentum was also evident in CRE, driven by healthy industry fundamentals in our footprint. We achieved this growth while adhering to our prudent underwriting standards and disciplined approach to portfolio management. Benefits from strategic growth initiatives are being realized, and we're excited about the potential of the corporate and investment banking team being led by Tom Deardorf, an industry veteran who joined the team in November growth momentum.\nIn Q4 was also supported by reduced pay-offs and increased C&I line utilization, which increased approximately 340 basis points to 43%. This is the first quarter where we have seen clear evidence of inflection toward increased utilization. We also saw continued growth in commitments up 4.4% or $512 million, which positions us well for economic expansion, particularly in the southeast, where growth is expected to exceed national averages. A continued normalization of C&I line utilization on today's balance sheet would result in over $350 million in funding balances, which should occur over time as liquidity subsides.\nWithin our core consumer portfolio, the trend remains somewhat mixed with growth in card and other consumer products is more than offset by continued declines in the mortgage. In aggregate, core consumer balances declined by $20 million in the quarter. Looking outside of our core lending activities, we did see a modest decline in our third-party portfolio in Q4, as purchases were more than offset by elevated pay-down activity. Additionally, our securities portfolio ended the quarter at $11 billion, up $400 million from the prior quarter, though that growth generally dragged out of the overall balance sheet and remained at 19% of total assets.\nThese portfolios will remain central to our overall balance sheet management efforts, and we'll continue to leverage both as a means to manage our capital and our liquidity positions. Slide 6 highlights the deposit trends for the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2021. As you can see, it was another very strong year for growth led by core transaction account balances, which were up $1.3 billion or 4% in the fourth quarter and up $5.1 billion or 16% for the full year. Notably, the majority of the growth for the year was in non-interest-bearing deposits, while we've seen continued strategic declines in time deposits.\nFor Q4, our total cost of deposits continued to decline to 12 basis points, which was down one basis point from the third quarter. The fourth quarter also experienced seasonal inflows related to public funds, while broker deposits were relatively stable. Both of these portfolios experienced declines versus one year ago, and we expect further declines in the first quarter as seasonal balances normalize and as we further reduce broker balances. In the first quarter, we expect broker deposits to decline by approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion as we efficiently manage our significant liquidity position.\nSlide 7 shows a total net interest income of $392 million in the fourth quarter or $380 million, excluding the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program. NII growth largely resulted from strong earning asset growth, which began late in the third quarter and continued through the fourth quarter. The net interest margin for the fourth quarter ended at 2.96%, a decline of five basis points from the prior quarter. As expected, the wind-down of the Paycheck Protection Program is serving as a notable NII headwind.\nExcluding the impact of PPP, the margin was stable in the quarter. Our portfolio remains asset-sensitive and stands to benefit from increases in rates across the yield curve. To that end, I would note that much of the loan production we saw in the second half of 2021 was variable rates. The portion of our portfolio that is floating rate now stands at 58%, which helps to support our NII sensitivity estimated at an increase of 6.5% for a 1% immediate increase in rates.\nAdjusted noninterest revenue of $116 million is highlighted on Slide 8, up $2 million from the prior quarter. This includes a one-time, $8 million increase of BOLI income that offsets a $4 million reduction in mortgage income. Wealth management continues to see an increase in fee revenue and assets under management, recording its seventh consecutive quarter of growth. This growth is driven by continued strong client acquisition and asset inflows.\nFrom a capital markets perspective, we recorded another strong quarter despite overcoming headwinds from a large one-time arranger fee. In the third quarter, that was not expected to repeat. As our commercial segments continue their robust growth, we should expect to see continued strength from arranger fees and swap income that will drive this line item. On a full-year basis, NIR excluding security gains increased 5%.\nDespite headwinds driven by the normalization of mortgage revenues. Drivers of this growth included wealth management and core banking fees, which increased 24% and 20% year over year, respectively. Within core banking fees, commercial cash management revenue increased $10 million, or 34% year over year. This growth represents the momentum within our commercial segment, including the deep depository relationships we have with our core customers.\nSlide 9 highlights a total adjusted non-interest expense of $286 million, up $19 million from the prior quarter. This change included both recurring expense increases and other notable expenses that we do not believe will repeat in future quarters. Recurring expense increases totaled $9 million and were driven by several factors, including growth initiatives related to Synovus forward, investments in tech and risk infrastructure, additional FDIC expenses, and expenses related to normalized travel and entertainment spending. Other notable expense increases total $10 million and consisted of $4 million of incremental performance-based management bonuses, a $4 million seed gift into a newly established donor-advised fund, and a $2 million increase in health insurance expense driven by seasonal and pandemic related factors.\nIn spite of an elevated quarter of expenses, we were able to manage the flat year-over-year adjusted expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage in 2021. Benefits from the successful implementation of other foreign initiatives can be seen in comparison to key areas from 2020 to 2021, particularly in base salaries, third-party spending, and real estate spending. These reductions have helped lay the groundwork for future strategic growth initiatives. The credit metrics on Slide 10 show continuing improvement in all key categories.\nThe net charge-off ratio fell 11 basis points to 0.11% while criticizing classified loans declined 16%. The NPA ratio declined five basis points to 0.4% and the NPL ratio declined eight basis points to 0.33%. Past dues dropped one basis point to 0.14% excluding the increase from Paycheck Protection Program loans. There was a reversal of provision for credit losses, a $55 million in the fourth quarter, as further improvement in the economic outlook was partially offset by significant loan growth.\nThe ACL ratio, excluding PPP loans, declined 21 basis points to 1.21%. On Slide 11 is a recap of our capital management efforts through 2021. In the fourth quarter, we executed the remaining $33 million of our 2021 authorization. And in doing so, we ended the quarter with our CET1 ratio at 9.5%.\nFor the year, we retired 4.4 million shares or approximately 3% of the common shares outstanding from the end of the prior year. Our ongoing capital management efforts have helped maintain strong and stable capital ratios, which along with core PPNR, positions us well for continued balance sheet growth in 2022. For 2022, our capital plan continues the prioritization of capital for client growth while returning an appropriate amount to our shareholders in the form of a dividend. That includes an increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend by $0.1 to $0.34, which would first be payable in April.\nWhile our two 2022 plan also includes an authorization for up to $300 million in share repurchases are capital priorities, our focus is on supporting core client growth, and managing our CET1 ratio around the target level of 9.5%. As we look ahead, we believe this focus on maintaining a strong capital position and prioritizing core growth is not only in the best interest of our shareholders, but also our clients, our communities, and our broader set of stakeholders. I'll turn it back to Kevin for greater detail that includes our 2022 outlook."

      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Thanks, Jamie. Excluding the impact of $400 million in remaining P3 balances, we expect loan growth of 4% to 7% in 2022. This growth assumes continued strong production in commercial lending, some curtailment of prepayment activity, particularly in the CRE portfolio, and relatively stable line utilization. The adjusted revenue outlook of 4% to 7% largely aligns with the current rate expectations, assuming three FOMC rate hikes and excludes the impact of P3-related revenue.\nOverall fee income growth will be muted due to the industrywide reduction in secondary mortgage revenue. However, we expect continued growth in strategic fee categories, including core banking fees and wealth management. Our adjusted expense outlook of 2% to 5% incorporates increases in compensation, a return to pre-pandemic travel and business development levels, and includes our strategic investments in talent and technology. XP3, we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage in 2022 while building out the bank of the future.\nBenefits from Synovus forward initiatives will continue to offset increased inflationary pressures and will remain disciplined and agile in terms of managing expense growth throughout the year. One significant efficiency initiative that is underway is the closing of an additional 15% of our branch locations, with an estimated run-rate savings of approximately $12 million by year-end. Moving to capital, as Jamie shared earlier, we extended the upper range of our targeted CET1 ratio by 25 basis points, providing a new range of 9.25% to 9.75%. This range will continue to support our strategic growth objectives while maintaining more than adequate protection against significant adverse conditions if they were to arise.\nAnd in the terms of capital, core relationship growth remains our top priority for capital deployment, while whole bank M&A is not a priority. We believe these expectations for 2022 support our continued progress toward becoming a sustained top quartile performer. We have a tremendous amount of momentum in our core businesses, and the team is performing at a very high level. Given the heightened levels of inflation, it appears the interest rate environment will serve as a tailwind in 2022 as we continue to position the balance sheet for asset sensitivity.\nWe also believe that our strategic investments will begin to drive top-line growth during the year. We are making good progress on the build-out of our Banking as a Service product called Mast and are seeing strong talent pipelines for the corporate and investment banking build-out. For all of these reasons, my confidence in delivering on our 2022 business and financial objectives is very high, and I know our team is poised and ready to win. Operator, we're now ready to begin Q&A."

      "speech": "Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Steven Alexopoulos",
      "speech": "Hi, good morning, everyone."
    },

      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Good morning, Steve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Steven Alexopoulos",
      "speech": "Wanted to start. So on Slide 5, the 30% increase in production is almost off the charts when you look at a chart. Could you give me more color on the increase was a tie to existing customers getting more active? Or were these share gains coming through in the quarter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Yes, Steven, it's a little bit of both. And when you look at the 30% you can look at it both a significant increase in CRE. And when you look at the asset classes that we were able to increase production, it led to growth in eight sub-asset classes. So we saw growth in warehouses, we saw growth in the hospitality, shopping, senior housing.\nAnd so it was really across the board. Now in terms of new clients versus the existing book came from both. So we continue to take share from other competitors. At the same time, we have seen our existing clients become a little more active from a demand standpoint.\nSimilar story on the C&I side, with strong growth there as well. And if you look at it from a MACs code perspective, you would see that five of the MACs codes that we cover grew greater than $100 million. So very broad-based. Again, new clients as well as existing customers.\nline utilization actually increased about $230 million during the quarter in C&I. So it was about two percentage points and obviously that would have largely come from existing clients."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Steven Alexopoulos",
      "speech": "OK, that's helpful color. And then to follow up. So if we look at the outlook for 47% loan growth in 2022 without PPP, I see you're calling for line utilization to hold about flat, but prepayment activity to normalize. So help me understand if the improved outlook for 2022 is tied to increased expectations for new clients or onboarding? Or is this because you think prepayment levels are going to decline quite a bit in 2022?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "More the former. So as we look out into our forecast and our pipelines, we think production levels will remain elevated as we onboard some of our new team members that will add additional incremental production to what we're already doing. So it's much more of a production story. I think when you start breaking down the balance sheet next year, just look at the commercial side.\nWe think we can grow mid to high single-digit commercial loan growth next year. We're keeping the third-party consumer portfolio flat, and the core consumer portfolio may shrink a little bit just based on some of the churns that are happening there. So we mentioned the pay-off activity because the last two quarters we've seen about $2 billion of pay-off activity. We generally have averaged over the last nine quarters about $1.5 billion, so it was elevated by about $0.5 billion.\nWe think over the year that will continue to decline. We saw a lot of activity, especially on the CRE front, given lower cap rates. So we think that will subside. But the bigger driver around loan growth in the mid to high single-digit commercial loan growth is around production."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Steven Alexopoulos",
      "speech": "It's production. OK, that's really helpful. Maybe, Kevin, if I could squeeze one more in. So you covered a lot in terms of what the company accomplished this year, and I know Investor Day actually 2021, but Investor Day is around the corner.\nFrom a revenue perspective. Maybe give us a bit of a teaser on Investor Day, like what initiatives are you most excited about for 2022 on the revenue side? Thanks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Well, look, I think obviously the asset sensitivity that we're putting ourselves in a position to be able to drive NII. But from a revenue standpoint, the initiatives, I'll start with Mast. We've talked a lot about how the industry is changing, especially around small businesses. I think that Mast is going to give us a platform to provide the software providers, a very flexible, configurable, brandeable, embedded finance platform.\nAnd as we've talked with those software vendors, they haven't had an offering that combines both banking as a service platform with payments, as a service platform. So when we look at the uniqueness of what we're providing in the timing to be able to roll out our pilot in the second quarter, I think it has a tremendous opportunity to start to drive revenue next year. Now, Jamie mentioned in his comments that we are planning to invest in 2022, and that's about $25 million worth of expense. We think even those initiatives will be able to record revenues that cover almost $20 million of revenue during the year.\nSo we're not looking for large paybacks, but the benefit of those new initiatives will continue to build through 2022 into 2023. The second, I would mention, is just our corporate and investment bank. We've made great progress in just the short 50 days that Tom Deardorf has been with us, he is building pipelines and already starting to line up talent. We expect to onboard as many as 15 team members in the second quarter of this year, and those individuals will hit the ground running and also start to provide revenue."

      "speaker": "Michael Rose",
      "speech": "Good. So obviously, the outlook includes, some rate hikes here just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about, further, build in the securities portfolio. Assuming we do get those rates, and just remind us again, where the comfort level is with the size of that portfolio? Thanks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah, Michael, that's a great question. As we look forward to 2022, we do expect to build or grow the securities portfolio on the margin. We're at 19% of assets today and we could see getting up to 20%. But we're going to be very prudent in that.\nAnd really, it's a reaction to all the other movements on the balance sheet. As Kevin mentioned, we're forecasting strong client loan growth. We expect that to continue. We expect deposit growth to allow us to continue to look at the mix of deposits, but all of those considerations play together.\nBut in our base case forecast, we do expect some marginal growth in the portfolio."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Rose",
      "speech": "OK, that's helpful. And then just back to loans. So the range is somewhat wide, which is understandable. Can you just help us appreciate what factors would drive you toward the upper end versus the lower end? I assume it's a combination of pay-offs and pay downs and utilization assumptions and things like that.\nBut if you can put a finer point on it, I'd appreciate it. Thanks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Yeah, Michael, I think you nailed it. I think we feel very confident in the production levels and we're going into 2022 assuming it's going to be a very constructive economic environment. Obviously, there are challenges still in front of us as it relates to the supply chain and potentially we don't know the impact of any other pandemic influences. And so we kept the range a little wider.\nI think we were being conservative knowing that there are some things there that continue to present some challenges. And more importantly, I would tell you that we kept the third parties at zero and that this year represented significant growth. And if we see the same liquidity positioning that we have -- we had in 2021, we also know that can flex up and we haven't assumed that in the forecast. But it's more so just some of the unknown variables that we kept the range that wide.\nBut we're very confident, as I mentioned and the commercial lending side, we saw tremendous momentum in the fourth quarter and we think that's going to carry over into the first quarter throughout this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Michael Rose",
      "speech": "Very helpful, and if I could just squeeze one last thing. You mentioned the $300 authorization, but don't get the sense that you guys are going to be really active with the buyback this year. Obviously, given some of the investments that you're making. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "That is the right way to think about it. I think the fourth quarter is a really good example of how we plan to deploy capital if the environment remains as we expect in 2022. If you look at our capital generation, PPNR capital generation of 46 basis points, and then you net out the dividend, you have an accretion in the mid-30s.\u00a0 And that's exactly what we deployed to risk-weighted assets to core client loan growth in the fourth quarter. Now, that's a pretty high growth rate, but that's the context of how we will look to manage it.\nIs to deploy the capital we generate through earnings to our clients on the balance sheet. And then we will use share repurchases as a toggle on the back end to manage our capital CET1 ratios to the target."

      "speech": "I guess just on loan growth, maybe it's just me, but in a world where like nominal GDP is going to be maybe 7%, 8% in 2022, things are reopening. Shouldn't loan growth be much stronger given all the investments you made, given the franchise exposure to Atlanta, Florida? Just talk to us in terms of upside risks. And also, if you could remind us what normalization and line utilization imply for loan balances. I know it's not baked into your forecast, but it will be a good number to have in terms of what loan balances could look like if things actually normalize?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Ebrahim, I'll start with that. With the slight increase that we saw in the fourth quarter if things normalize back into that mid 40% range, we're talking about another 500 million-plus in outstandings. And we're not including that in our forecast. So back to your point in terms of if we saw 7% GDP growth.\nI think you would see line utilization increase and again, not included in our assumptions. We went into our forecasting for next year assuming GDP in the 3% to 4% range. And we think that if the economy is stronger than that, obviously to your point, there could be an upside. I just mentioned that there's an upside if we decide to deploy additional capital and liquidity into the third-party partnership loans.\nAnd, our bankers have continued to produce at a higher level than we thought. So the real driver there is the productivity level of our bankers. And you're right, we have markets that are performing very well. Atlanta continues to perform very well and we're bringing on new talent in Florida, in our corporate and investment banking world.\nAnd so the faster that those individuals on board additional talent and we built a budget for that, the faster the loan growth will come. And so there are a lot of variables, we wanted to see and forecast what we see in front of us based on the economic forecast that we have and based on the team members and the expectations for those folks. But obviously, there's an opportunity to outperform if we hit on all those cylinders."

      "speech": "So that's helpful, Kevin. Thank you. And just on a separate question, I see your adjusted revenue guidance. But if we can just, unpack on the fee revenue outlook.\nObviously, building out the corporate investment bank. Give us a sense of the puts and takes on fee revenue. Or is that going to outperform, underperform that adjusted revenue guidance, and what the puts and takes are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah, Ibrahim. As we look forward into 2022 on the on fee revenue, we do expect fee revenue to be down year over year. And the reason for that is there are headwinds in the mortgage, as you look at the normalization of the mortgage. And you still have those strong quarters in early 2021.\nSo we expect mortgage revenue to be down. Higher interest rates will impact production there. But then we also had benefits in fee revenue in both BOLI income as well as equity gains in 2021 that we're not expecting to recur in 2022. So those are more environmental headwinds.\nBut I wouldn't -- I don't want that to take away from the broad-based growth that we expect to see in really every other line item outside of NSF, as we look forward into 2022. I mean, our core banking fees, the deposit service charge, card fees, we're expecting broad-based growth across the board outside of those both unique to 2021 headwinds and the mortgage normalization."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ebrahim Poonawala",
      "speech": "Got it. And if I can just sneak in one follow-up on the investment bank buildout. I'm assuming you have some of the safe for Investor Day. But just give us a sense of the ramp-up in terms of hiring that you're doing right now? And are there any certain verticals that you're particularly focused on as you build that out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah. Ibrahim. So we are focusing on three initial verticals tech and media communications, healthcare, and financial institutions group. And one of the things that we've asked Tom to do is to time this such that, as the time of the year, we're not recruiting people to come in today.\nWe're waiting for them to finish out their year and receive their bonus payments from their previous institution. And so you would expect to see probably, as I said, 15 folks join us in the second quarter, maybe even early third quarter. From a timing standpoint. And so we're looking for teams of individuals to fit those specific industry verticals.\nAnd to your point on fee income, I think what you're going to see in the beginning is a lot of coverage banking. So you're going to see the traditional lending capabilities with our syndicated finance. Opportunity to offload some of those outstanding and you're going to see the depository and treasury business first. Now, over time, we'll continue to build out some of the capital market solutions that those size clients need.\nAnd so it would be an increased debt capital markets capability. It may be things like securitizations, but originally these guys are going to focus on just the coverage banking side. So you'll see it more on the NII side than you'll see on the fee income side, to begin with.\nGot it. And I assume that some of this hiring is baked into your expense guide for the year that you provided.\nIt all is. And so as I mentioned earlier we have included about $25 million for all of our investments in the 2022 expense guidance and that includes things like CIB. It includes Mast, but it also includes building out our middle-market teams in Florida. So the guidance that we provided, would be inclusive of all of those investments.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we think that $25 million could generate as much as $20 million of revenue next year. So you can see it's a fairly quick payback period when we make those investments."

    {
      "speaker": "Brad Milsaps",
      "speech": "Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, I was just curious if you could offer maybe a little more color around just how asset sensitive you are. I know you give the interest rate table in the deck. But I was curious if you could, maybe define just maybe in basis points kind of what you feel like each rate increase would have in terms of impacting the NIM? And how much are rates apart? I know you have three in there, but maybe on a percentage basis.\nWhat percentage is that of your revenue guidance in 2022 that would be related to rates?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah. So first off, as you can look at our core balance sheet and you look at the ratio of floating rate loans to total loans, you can see that increasing over time. So our native asset sensitivity is increasing and we're pleased with that gives our outlook for interest rates. Further, the exposure -- relative exposure to the front in the curve will increase as long-term rates increase and premium amortization declines.\nSo you'll see that happening as we have these increases and longer-term interest rates that we're seeing. But as of the year-end, that's what our metrics are in the earnings deck. Our relative exposure between the short and the long in the curve was relatively balanced when you assume 35% beta and that's ours through the cycle estimate that's embedded in our NII sensitivity tables. But we believe it's likely, depending on the velocity and the magnitude of rate moves, that -- the deposit data is lower in the initial stages of a fed tightening cycle.\nAnd so if you were to isolate that sensitivity to the front end of the curve and hold the back end of the curve constant and use a 20% beta, for example. And that's what's consistent with our revenue guidance. We would expect the margin to expand approximately three basis points in the first-rate move and four basis points thereafter. And to your question, around the total impact, as far as our guidance of 4% to 7% revenue growth, our expectations for rate moves are April, August, December.\nSo obviously, December does not have much of an impact for this year. But you can think about the partial year impact of April and August, which is less than 1% of that total revenue."

      "speaker": "Brad Milsaps",
      "speech": "Great, thank you. And then just as my follow-up. Just on the credit side of\u00a0 the equation you guys were around 21 basis points of charge offs for the year, I think that's pretty well in line with your 20 to 25. Any change in the way you're thinking about that in 2022.\nAnd I mean, it looks like you've kind of exhausted most of your ability to take down the reserve. But just any comments around that would be helpful as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "No changes in our outlook -- medium-term outlook for charge-offs. You're right, the low 20s area is a good baseline as we look forward to 2022. With regards to the allowance and our life-of-loan estimates in our CECL calculations. If the economic outlook continues to improve and uncertainty declines in the outlook.\nThen we do still expect to see the ACL to loan ratio to decline to approximately the day one levels. For us, that was 1.06%. Obviously, the loan makes it a little bit different today than it was back a couple of years ago. But we do believe that day one levels are an appropriate outlook for the medium term."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "Yeah. Yeah, Jennifer, I think, what we've said is that we think in the first three years this can contribute upwards of $3 billion of loans from a commitment standpoint. But all of that is predicated on the fact that we recruit the teams that we're targeting and we bring them in within the timeframes that we've established. But this can be a meaningful impact on our overall balance sheet.\nBut based on the size of our balance sheet, you can see that it's obviously going to be less than 10% of total loans. But from a fee income standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, it's going to start off as being relatively more of an NII story. Just based on the coverage nature of these bankers. But over time, we'll continue to add capabilities and just the size of their business.\nFrom a Treasury standpoint, there will be fee income that's generated there. But we haven't shared at this point because it's such a tough number to be able to provide without knowing the timing and the size of the teams that will be able to onboard."

      "speech": "Yeah. Yeah. Well, look, I think the way in which you recruit environments like this, number one is you have to offer plat -- you have to offer up a platform for which bankers want to come and work at. And one of the reasons that Tom Deardorf came here and he's going to be at our Investor Day, so you'll get a chance to meet him was the attraction of being able to come to a bank that is of our size, that has the capabilities and functionality that we have.\nBut provides an environment that allows those bankers to really serve their clients. And so our platform is very attractive to those bankers, especially from a corporate and investment banking side. Two, salary is obviously important and you'll hear that from us as we look at our expense guidance. We recognize the changing landscape around salary inflation.\nBut I don't think that's the most important thing. We have to provide an incentive plan that is -- that allows individuals to be paid for their success. And we were building that as we speak and that will attract folks here. And then lastly, I would tell you that, the people like Tom, who are well-respected leaders in the industry, they attract people because they know that these individuals have -- that Tom has a great track record of success and that they want to come work for folks like him.\nSo you have the right leaders, you have the right comp packages and you give them the right platform. You can attract top talent from around the industry."

But I guess if we strip all of that out I have you guys like $109 million in core fee income this quarter. And so just because given the pipeline on Mast, given all the investments you've made, investments you've made on the fee income side of the house.\nMaybe setting CIB aside because I know that's a long tail on that revenue source. But I guess I'm struggling to see why the revenue guide would be down from here because it would kind of imply that $109 million is what you're expecting for the run rate for next year, at least on a core basis. And so maybe just some, some greater clarity there. Setting aside kind of the onetime items would be helpful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah. Yeah. Good question, and to dive into that a little bit. I mean, we still -- if you look at the growth in wealth management fees, I mean, it's a sustained growth rate.\nIf you look at our core banking fees, we feel really good about the sustained growth rate of those businesses and even core banking fees that had a really strong 2021. We're expecting those to continue increasing in the high single digits in 2022. And so, we do expect to see this broad-based growth continue. And the headwinds, though, are fairly significant.\nI mean, you have approximately a $10 million year-over-year change in BOLI income. You have a little less than $10 million on gains on equity investments. And then you have normalization of the mortgage. And in percentage terms, these are large headwinds and they have nothing to do with our core business performance of what we're doing.\nBut they are headwinds when you have when you're comparing year over year. And so we believe that those initiatives like Mast, we believe that initiatives like CIB when you think about the fee revenue in that business. We believe those will all be tailwinds to NIR growth. But as Kevin just mentioned, that's likely to be a little delayed than just coming in and having the full year 2022 benefit.\nAnd so we will speak more to the financial statement impact longer-term in a couple of weeks when we have Investor Day. But that's -- we believe that we have a platform that's actually proven to have sustainable strong fee revenue growth, and we're going to augment that with these strategic initiatives. Unfortunately, in 2022, we have this headwind of mortgage normalization and then these other one-offs in equity investments and BOLI. So that's that's kind of a little deeper dive into the full story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Brody Preston",
      "speech": "OK. Got it. And then maybe it's on the expense front. So if I strip out -- if I strip out all the one-time items, including the donation that you all set up, core expenses running about $282 million or so.\nAnd so, looking at the guidance side and looking at fourth quarter results, it kind of implies that, you would expect expenses to be flattish from this fourth quarter level on average throughout the rest of the year just taking the midpoint of the guidance. Is that an accurate assessment? And I guess, is there anything beyond the branch closures in an earlier, Kevin, that is driving that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah. That's a fair assumption and another way to look at that is if you roll forward from the third quarter and add what we define as recurring expenses, the $9 million in our presentation, you get to the mid-270s. And what you should expect to see in the first quarter is the normal seasonal employment expenses, approximately $7 million. And you add that on.\nAnd so to your point, that gets you into the low 280s and we believe that beyond the first quarter, that's when you'll start to see the normal inflationary pressures that come from employment expense, merit increases, etc. But also, I would just, include in that guidance, as Kevin mentioned, is approximately $25 million to spend on these growth initiatives. So what you see in there is growth initiatives beyond normal personnel expense increases rolling forward from the end of this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Blair",
      "speech": "And I would just add to you from a Synovus forward standpoint, we have in the appendix slide there that you can see we have another $15 million to $20 million of savings that will come in throughout the year. We referenced the $12 million on a branch. We have other savings as it relates to third-party spending and smaller items that add up to that number. But to be very clear, as Jamie mentioned, we're going to be monitoring the expenses throughout the year.\nI think we've proven this year by being able to go through a year and have our expenses flat. And so when you take our guidance for next year and this year over a two-year period, that's seen some of the highest inflation that I've seen in my time in banking. We'll be able to keep our total expense growth over that two years into that, 2% to 5% growth range. So we'll continue to pull the levers we have to pull.\nWe've been very -- I think, forthright in some of the initiatives that we've already executed that's delivered $55 million in expense reductions or headcount, down 5% year over year. And so we know that we have to look at the environment and every dollar that we can generate a new efficiency initiative from. It allows us to either drop into the bottom line or invest more in some of these strategic initiatives that we that we've established."

How do you expect -- what's your view for funding on that in terms of the expectation for deposit growth as well as cash deployment into those loan categories. And looking at some of those more optional areas you talked about, like the third-party originators. Is that really more going to be dependent upon liquidity than anything else?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jamie Gregory",
      "speech": "Yeah. As we look at funding the loan growth, we're in a very strong liquidity position. And so we do expect there to be a deposit growth tailwind that continues in 2022. But we believe that even with this growth outlook and how we're thinking about asset growth in 2022, including the securities growth that we will still have the opportunity to improve our deposit mix.\nAnd so what you should expect to see from us is core transaction deposit growth being net with a continued reduction in broker deposits, continued reduction in time deposits as we manage that mix. And so we believe that we have plenty of flexibility to do that. And that's our outlook for funding the loan growth. With regards to the third-party portfolio, we do view that as a surrogate for the investment portfolio and we will look to deploy assets into third-party loans as appropriate.\nYou can see in the third -- I mean in the fourth quarter that that portfolio was down quarter on quarter, but that's largely due to the fact that we didn't feel compelled to invest and chase assets in that portfolio when we had such strong client loan growth, which is our priority."

But when you -- and I appreciate your comment about M&A, that that's really not a focus for you all. But when you think about the prospect of bolting on certain markets, say in North Carolina.\nMaybe that's not an opportunity for this year. Maybe it's more next year. If you don't go about it or if you want to avoid M&A, is it on the radar at all to look to do lift outs of teams in certain metro markets and North Carolina into those seemed like they would be very attractive markets for you to add from a banking perspective. But maybe the investments are really or the opportunity for investing is spoken for in '22 maybe this is more of a '23 or beyond item.\nBut just wondering how you think of that long term, that prospect?

We actually do have a small loan production office in Charlotte today. But it's not a meaningful portfolio.\nMy belief is that I would rather go out and build industry expertise through some of our specialty verticals and have those individuals not be limited by geography. So that technically they can be national in their portfolio versus constraining a new LPO in a North Carolina market because I think that, it's very difficult. I believe to go in with a generalist banker in a marketplace where you don't have a strong brand and generate the type of value that I think we are generating with some of these specialty industry vertical hires that we've been able to make. So although I would never say never, it would be low on my priorities.\nI think we have a tremendous opportunity, first and foremost, to continue to invest in the five-state footprint that we serve. We continue to be able to pick up great talent from other institutions that are creating growth in our existing markets. We've announced recently two great hires in the middle market space in Florida. So we're going to focus inside our footprint.\nWe're going to continue to add some specialty skillset around the industry verticals and then, down the road.

So I think that the execution that they had this past year is indicative of the type of skillset we have in that team, but it also is a function of the way in which they go to market. They're not just asset managers.\nThese are our offerings. There is a business that goes out into these generational families and provides full service, and I think it is a unique value proposition. And we've won a lot of awards for being recognized for being unique. So I think you'll continue to see that business grow.\nOur leader there, Kathryn Dunlevy set out a plan several years ago to double the size of her business. And she's well on track in being able to deliver on that. So we are confident that she will continue to grow that business and it'll be something that will continue to provide not only growth on the fee side but also on the assets under the management side."

So we built a really strong pipeline with that product and we're out selling it to our clients today.

      "speech": "Absolutely. I think we said last quarter our pipeline with the accelerate AR was right around $6 million in product revenue and so over time, those will continue to grow. And that's what's going to fuel a lot of our treasury growth going forward. To this point, Katherine Weislogel and her team have done a great job of deepening the wallet share within treasury.\nWe now are starting to expand with these new businesses where she's getting a new sandbox to play in, but she's also adding new solutions that will also add to that revenue line. So it's really the three-legged stool, cross-sell into the existing book, expand through new segments and industries, and three, bring on new solutions and products."

      "speech": "Well, thank you, and I really thank everyone for your questions and your continued interest in Synovus. I also want to thank all of our team members who are on the call today. It's an extremely exciting time to be part of this company, and it's an honor to lead this passionate and high-performing team. I recently shared our 4 strategic pillars of transformation that will build out our bank of the future.\nI think this road map is well balanced between continuing to drive productivity and market share gains in our core businesses while folding in and extending new businesses and solutions to generate new sources of revenue. As we reposition our businesses for advantage, simplify and streamline, leverage a high-tech, high-touch approach to banking, we will also continue to invest in our team and new talent. Execution in these areas will continue to enhance our client experience and it's going to generate outsized growth. We've also received some good media coverage over the past few weeks as we've continued to onboard some expert talent, our new head of analytics joined us.\nBut we've also taken meaningful steps forward in the crypto space where we joined the US DF consortium, and we announced an investment along with other banks in the Jamintop-Fintech fund. We hope as Jamie mentioned earlier, you'll join us for our 2022 Investor Day on February 8 to hear more about the work that we're doing and how this work will fuel sustainable growth and allow us to deliver on our purpose. You will also have an opportunity to hear from many of our executive leadership team on how we have coordinated this effort and how we are collectively executing our strategies, and we'll also share some of our long-term financial targets at that event. So as we close again, thank you for joining today.\nThanks for your interest in Synovus. And operator, with that, we will conclude today's call."
